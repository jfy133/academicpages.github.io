I am a biomolecular archaeologist carrying out [my Ph.D.](http://www.shh.mpg.de/employees/45083/25522) on [ancient oral microbiomes](http://www.shh.mpg.de/348251/Evolution-and-Ecology-of-the-Human-Oral-Microbiome) in the [Department of Archaeogenetics](http://www.shh.mpg.de/28671/research_outline) at the [Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History](http://www.shh.mpg.de/en).

I originally trained as an Archaeologist at the University of York, where I specialised in palaeoproteomics. After which I moved to the Universität Tübingen to study for an M.Sc. in Archaeological Sciences, specialising in the palaeogenetics. During my time in Tübingen I also worked as a technician for a stable isotope lab.

My current area of research is centered on the ancient DNA content of fossilised dental plaque from palaeolithic to recent archaeological skeletons. I am primarily exploring how we can analyse and [authenticate](http://www.jafy.eu/publication/2017-04-17-robust-framework-microbial-archaeology) the complex genetic makeup of this material through shotgun metagenomics.

Previously, I have worked on Late Pleistocene woolly mammoth mitochondrial genomes, as well as testing collagen 'fingerprinting' methods (ZooMS) on burnt skeletal remains.
