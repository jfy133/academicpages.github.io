**SPAAM2: Standards Precautions and Advances in Ancient Metagenomics**: I established, co-organised, chaired and also presented at the SPAAM2 round-table discussion workshop. Involving 80 ancient metagenomic researchers from around the world, we discussed a wide range of topics spanning the challenges of ancient microbiome, pathogenomic and environmental DNA reconstruction. In particular to co-chairing the large session entitled "Authentication, standards, and reproducibility in ancient metagenomic research.", I gave a presentation entitled "Towards standards in metadata reporting in ancient metagenomic studies: experiences from AncientMetagenomeDir", co-written with Antonio Fernandez Guerra. More information on SPAAM2 can be found on the [SPAAM community website](https://spaam-community.github.io/#/spaam2/README).
