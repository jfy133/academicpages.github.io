I am a biomolecular archaeologist carrying out my Ph.D. on [ancient oral microbiomes](http://www.shh.mpg.de/348251/Evolution-and-Ecology-of-the-Human-Oral-Microbiome) at the [Department of Archaeogenetics](http://www.shh.mpg.de/28671/research_outline) at the [Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History](http://www.shh.mpg.de/en) in Jena, Germany.

I originally trained as an Archaeologist at the University of York (United Kingdom), where I specialised in palaeoproteomics. After which I moved to the Universität Tübingen (Germany) to study for an M.Sc. in Archaeological Sciences specialising in the palaeogenetics. During my time in Tübingen, I also worked as a lab technician for a stable isotope lab.

My current area of research is centered on the ancient DNA content of fossilised dental plaque from archaeological skeletons. I am primarily exploring how we can analyse and authenticate the complex genetic makeup of this material through shotgun metagenomics. My previous research has been on the reconstruction of and phylogenetic analysis of Late Pleistocene woolly mammoth mitochondrial genomes, and testing collagen 'fingerprinting' methods (ZooMS) on burnt skeletal remains.
