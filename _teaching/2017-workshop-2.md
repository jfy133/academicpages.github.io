Overview
======

This workshop was a part of the MPI-SHH 'Methods Bootcamp' seminar series, given by James A. Fellows Yates and Ron Huebler. This session introduced the basic concepts behind alignment, mapping of next generation sequencing DNA data and common programs used. We also gave practical examples of how different data compression techniques worked in these concepts.
