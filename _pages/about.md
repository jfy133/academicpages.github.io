Hey! I am a biomolecular archaeologist currently carrying out my Ph.D. on
ancient oral microbiomes through ancient DNA (aDNA). I originally trained as an
archaeologist at the University of York (UK) where I worked on palaeoproteomics
(specifically the collagen 'fingerprinting' method ZooMS). I then moved to the
University of TÃ¼bingen where I studied archaeological science specialising in
ancient DNA of woolly mammoths, but I also worked in a stable isotope lab as a
technician. Now I am at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human
History in Jena for my Ph.D.

My main Ph.D. project is entitled the 'Evolution of the Oral Microbiome', in
which I am studying the genetic content of archaeological dental calculus from
across the world from the palaeolithic to the present. I am primarily exploring
what (reliable) information can be obtained from this substrate through shotgun
metagenomics, both in terms of the microbial content as well possible other
sources of the genetic content.
