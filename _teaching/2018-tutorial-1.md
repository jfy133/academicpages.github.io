Alongside [Thiseas Lamnidis](https://www.shh.mpg.de/person/45025/25522), we wrote a tutorial to give a very gentle introduction (with many terrible jokes) to how to use the bash terminal for people with **little- to no experience of the command line**. While we wrote this in the context of bioinformatics at the MPI-SHH, we feel parts to all of it is generally applicable to all newcomers to the terminal.

Thus, we made this tutorial avaliable online at GitHub under a CC-BY-SA 4 License [here](https://github.com/TCLamnidis/BareBonesBash).
